          Flow Grow is a task management app that I had a small idea for
          developing and then had the opportunity to flesh it out for an
          assignment in a Mobile Development class at UCF. The idea for the
          application stems from the concept that we work best when we are in
          our "flow". It's also a play on the word "flower", since when we are
          able to achieve our tasks and goals daily, we grow healthy habits.
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
          I started by creating the wireframe and design layout in Figma, then
          by selecting the bright color palette and designing the "Flow Grow"
          flower logo. Due to time constraints, the prototype application,
          developed with React Native, is missing some of the details from the
          design. However, in the future, I hope to develop my design and idea
          to its fullest potential. In the simple prototype, the user may create
          new tasks, name them, and then check them off once completed.
