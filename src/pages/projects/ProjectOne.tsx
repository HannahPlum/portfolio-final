          This Rock Paper Scissors game was created for an Interactive Design
          class at UCF. It was created using Figma, and was solely used as a
          high fidelity prototype for the class assignment. However, I believe
          this app would work well if redesigned with React for Mobile
          Applications.
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
          The application was inspired by the game "Rock Paper Scissors" which
          is typically played with hands and two players. I wanted the user to
          have the ability to play Rock Paper Scissors, even if a second player
          was not available. The user may play against a randomized computer, or
          select "online play" to test their skill against another human online.
